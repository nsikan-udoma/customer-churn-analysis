# Customer Churn Analysis
Dollar Bank Customer Churn Analysis using SQL + Python + Tableau:  An end-to-end project that involved exploratory analysis with SQL, a deep-dive EDA using Python, and building an interactive dashboard with Tableau to present meaningful business insights for the bank. 

Overall, the bank had a churn rate of 16%, meaning that 16% of customers stopped using the bank's credit card services in the given time period. Customer churn varied significantly by age, with the highest churn rates among customers in their 40's and 50's.
Customers with higher income earnings tended to have lower churn rates, while those with lower income earnings were more likely to churn. Most customers across all income categories owned blue credit cards, with the female blue credit card holders earning less than $40k churning the most. Customers who had a higher number of transactions and spent higher amounts per transaction tended to have lower churn rates, suggesting that engagement and activity were important factors in retaining customers.

Established customers - those who had been with the bank for 25 to 36 months â€“ churned the most, with a churn rate of 5% for females and 3.6% for males. Additionally, long-term customers (those with the bank for 37-48 months) had the second-highest churn rate in both female and male customers, with rates of 2.8% and 2.3%, respectively. These findings suggested that the bank needed more efforts in retaining its established and long-term customers in all income categories. Pareto analysis was used to identify the 20% (vital few) area of interest for each custom demographic customer segment. And Targeted marketing ad campaigns were recommended to effectively target members of the 20% vital few. Campaigns included: Rewards and incentives e.g sign-up bonuses, or cash back rewards on purchases made with their credit cards. Another effective campaign would be partnering with fitness brands and offering discounts on gym memberships or workout gears etc.
