## Introduction 
Dollar Bank Customer Churn Analysis using SQL + Python + Tableau:  An end-to-end project that involved exploratory analysis with SQL, a deep-dive EDA using Python, and building an interactive dashboard with Tableau to present meaningful business insights for the bank. 

## Methodology
SQL queries were used to explore and understand the data, and joining all 3 datasets was critical in answering research questions to generate valuable insights for the business. Python deep-dive analysis took this a step further by drilling down into the data to understand the different variables, their datatypes, summary statistics, checking for outliers, and assessing both data quality and tidiness issues that required data cleaning. Performing a distribution analysis for each variable identified unique values and variables that showed potential in providing useful business insights. A cross-correlation analysis helped to check for the relationship between variables and identify variables of interests that can help solve the business problem at hand; which is the ultimate question for the bank - "Why are customers churning?" See link below.

Overall, the bank had a churn rate of 16%, meaning that 16% of customers stopped using the bank's credit card services in the given time period. Customer churn varied significantly by age, with the highest churn rates among customers in their 40's and 50's.
Customers with higher income earnings tended to have lower churn rates, while those with lower income earnings were more likely to churn. Most customers across all income categories owned blue credit cards, with the female blue credit card holders earning less than $40k churning the most. Customers who had a higher number of transactions and spent higher amounts per transaction tended to have lower churn rates, suggesting that engagement and activity were important factors in retaining customers.

Established customers - those who had been with the bank for 25 to 36 months â€“ churned the most, with a churn rate of 5% for females and 3.6% for males. Additionally, long-term customers (those with the bank for 37-48 months) had the second-highest churn rate in both female and male customers, with rates of 2.8% and 2.3%, respectively. These findings suggested that the bank needed more efforts in retaining its established and long-term customers in all income categories. Pareto analysis was used to identify the 20% (vital few) area of interest for each custom demographic customer segment. And Targeted marketing ad campaigns were recommended to effectively target members of the 20% vital few. 

## Recommendations
The analysis highlights the need for the bank to focus on retaining its established and long-term customers in all income categories, especially female blue cardholders earning less than $40k. By focusing on the vital few customer segments, Dollar Bank can reduce the overall churn rate to less than 7%, which is a generally acceptable churn rate level for most banks and credit card companies. The vital few of around 20% can be increased to 30% of the total churned customers to capture more customers segments and further reduce churn.

Targeted marketing ad campaigns should be used to effectively reach the customer segments contributing the most to churn. Examples of such campaigns include:

Providing financial education and resources to both male and female graduates, such as webinars, podcasts, or blog posts, to help them manage their finances more effectively, improve their financial literacy, and pay back student loans and other expenses without running into debt.
Partnering with brands that appeal to the target audience (e.g partnering with fitness brands and offering discounts on gym memberships or workout gears to male and female graduates who are married or single)
Creating a loyalty program specifically for established and long-term customers, which could include perks such as waived fees, free financial planning sessions, or personalized investment advice.
Providing personalized investment advice and retirement planning services to established and long-term customers, which could help them maximize their savings and achieve their long-term financial goals.
Offering credit counseling services to blue credit card holders who earn less than $40k per year, which could help them improve their credit scores and reduce their financial stress.
Rewards and incentives e.g sign-up bonuses, discounted interest rates on loans or cash back rewards on purchases, to increase credit card usage and attract new customers to the bank
